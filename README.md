Simple repo to gather data structures in Swift, and keeping myself updated!
I have published it in case that some one may need a quick cheat sheet. (Coming from some one who has 10 followers max XDDDDD)

Feel free to reach out if you needed any help, or if you have found something is wrong with the implementations :)

## What is inside:
Basic data structures such as:
1. Stack
2. Queue
   2.1. Simple Queue
   2.2. Advance Queue
4. LinkedList
   4.1. SinglyLinkedList
   4.2. DoublyLinkedList
5. Tree
   5.1. BinaryTree
6. Graph
   6.1. Graph
   6.2. UndirectionalGraph
7. Small test cases to understand data structures beter

## How to contribute:
No limitations at all, just do it >:D

## TODO:
  1. Implement other tree data structures such as `BinarySearchTree`, `Heap`, `AVLTree`, etc..
  2. Implement Graphs
  3. Fix shallow copying
  4. Implement sort algorithms and other operations (e.g swap, reverese)
  5. Improve code readability
  6. Add `swiftformat` (and some Lint rules (maybe))
  7. Start doing leetcode?
